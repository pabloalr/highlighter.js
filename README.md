highlighter.js
==============

A jQuery plugin that allows for enabling tooltips on user selected text.

[Demo](http://huffpostlabs.github.com/highlighter.js/ "Demo")

Forked
------

This fork adds iFrame support.

Usage
-----

Include the script on your page (make sure to use the correct path here)

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="/js/jQuery.highlighter.js"></script>
```

Activate the highlighter on the element of your choice, e.g.

```javascript
$('.article').highlighter();
```

to deactivate it, use

```javascript
$('.article').highlighter('destroy');
```

The styling of the tooltip is completely up to you. This library will simply show and hide it in the correct position when appropriate.
You can use the ```selector``` option (see next section) to specify how highlighter.js can find your tooltip element. We have been using it with something like

```html
<span class='highlighter-container'>
    <div>
     ... my tooltip text ...
    </div>
</span>
```

Where the span has an absolute position, and the div is position relative.

### Options

On init you can pass in a settings object that will recognize two parameters:

```javascript
$('.article').highlighter({
                           'selector': '.highlighter-container',
                           'minWords': 0,
                           'iframeEl': '#myIframe'
});
```

Where ```selector``` is the jQuery selector string of the element that you want to show upon text being selected, and ```minWords``` is the minimum number of words that have
to be selected in order for the tooltip to appear. The defaults are ```'.highlighter-container'```, and ```0```, respectively.

And ```ìframeEl````is the selector string of your iframe.

Compatibility
------

This plugin has been tested in Chrome, Firefox, Safari and IE 9.
